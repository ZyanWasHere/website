# ISSUES

- comic sans turns to cursive on mobile?
- website updates faster on incognito browsers???
- filenames are innacurate
- folder structure needs fixing too


# NOTE TO SELF

- index.html --> https://www.zyanwashere.com/
- FILE.html --> https://www.zyanwashere.com/FILE.html
- FOLDER/FILE --> https://www.zyanwashere.com/FOLDER/FILE.html

UPDATE: DNS has been checked and confirmed. so now https://www.zyanwashere.com/ works!

BEFORE DNS:

- index.html is simply accessed with https://zyanwashere.github.io/website/
- any subsequent files are accessed with: https://zyanwashere.github.io/website/FILE.html
- unless it is in a folder, in which case: https://zyanwashere.github.io/website/FOLDER/FILE.html
