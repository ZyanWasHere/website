honestly, i'm tired. half of this is broken beyond repair.
wouldn't it be kinda nice if i just nuked it and started clean?
yeah... that sounds kind of nice. ALRIGHT that's the plan.
we nuke it, start from scratch. figure out a MUCH more efficient system...
and THEN come back to this. AAAAAAND BREAK (the site).
