## 2025-10
- started spooktober
- removed entire website!?
- working on a compiler for the website

honestly, i'm tired. the css and website compiler is broken beyond repair... wouldn't it be kinda nice if i just nuked it and started clean? yeah... that sounds kind of nice. ALRIGHT that's the plan. we nuke it, start from scratch. figure out a MUCH more efficient system... and THEN come back to this. AAAAAAND BREAK (the site).

one of the best things you can do is eliminate points of friction. for me: that occurs in a lot of the tools i use on a daily basis. recently i've been trying to make fast, consistent vertical content. i wanted to do more than just "upload clip", and that means a lot of the work goes into the visuals. to fix that i've been making custom tools to speed the process up. some of those tools come in the form of unity projects, some come in the form of fantasy consoles.

as this month continues i've been setting up: wheel of hobbies. a series where i try different hobbies, and share with you my journey. the idea caterpillar snuck inside the brain apple, and has lingered in there enough to become a project butterfly.
