# NOTE TO SELF

this is the first time using github pages. it's also the first time trying to understand how static pages work. from what i've gathered, index.html loads the actual website: https://zyanwashere.github.io/website/

2nd page was able to load via: https://zyanwashere.github.io/website/page%20two.html so it appears that https://zyanwashere.github.io/website/NAME.HTML would display it.
