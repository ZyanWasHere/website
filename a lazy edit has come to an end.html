<h1>a lazy edit has ended</h1>

<h2>what was "a lazy edit"</h2>
<p>i used to have a channel dedicated to blender / after effects tutorials that i could teach under a minute. this was before tiktok and vertical content. afterwards i also made videos breaking down how i made a lot of the VFX in my videos. when vertical content became mainstream i was showing how videogames modeled, textured, and rendered characters.</p>
<h2>it sounds interesting why did you stop?</h2>
<p>is what i hope you're asking... well turns out: researching, gathering models, trying to demonstrate high concepts and so forth takes a lot of time and energy. and it can be pretty demotivating when it doesn't pan out. i don't care if "lets play number 67" doesn't take off because frankly its meaningless. it's for fun, but there's little inherent value apart from what entertainment people can get from it.</p>
<p>but a lazy edit wasn't just "fun content" it was trying to be educational, it was trying to be accurate, it was trying to teach to an audience. and that's pretty demotivating when there's no audience. eventually when vertical content came around, some of the things i did gained traction. some of the vertical videos got over a million views. but those were clear outliers. and on average it was difficult to gain ANY traction...</p>

<h2>so you quit?</h2>
<p>rude. but yes. in early 2024, i planned to officially archive the channel. i think every project has a shelf life and its naive and can stunt your growth to cling onto projects that have gone beyond their lifespan. kill your darlings, and all that.</p>
<p>i learned a lot. every single video on a lazy edit taught me something about vfx, graphic design, player testing, 3d modeling. i think the biggest thing it taught me was how to start, and then end a project. you go fast, experiment, and have a goal to shoot for. if it doesn't work, you have checked your boxes, crossed your t's and dotted your i's.</p>

<h2>would you revive this project?</h2>
<p>well, throughout 2024 i made a series of vertical videos which ended up performing relatively well. i think that's good because it tells me that: there is a demand for this kind of media. it tells me that if i restructured some of the contents it could work.</p>
<p>but its also a project that i had been doing for over 5 years at that point. its a project that i loved and cared about, but one that i realized i'm ready to move on from. if it were to be made again: i would certainly play a lesser role in the project, have someone else research it, have someone else narrate it. have more hands on the project, and be more hands off.</p>
