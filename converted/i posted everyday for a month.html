<h1>i posted everyday for a month</h1>
<h2>cool, but why on earth would you do that to yourself</h2>
<p>fair point. in 2025-06 i was in bummerland. i missed making videos, and wanted to get back on the digital horse. i am a creative person, i like making things - it bums me out not making things. and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZyanWasHere">the main channel</a> is a good outlet for that. often though, you spend hours, days, weeks(!?) making a video - only for you to run out of steam before its even out the door. and daily content is the antithesis of that. you are litterately unable to stall - you are unable to overthink - you simply act. enter: daily upload challenge! i'd upload 3 vertical videos a day, and 1 horizontal video, for a month.</p>
<h2>24 hours isn't a lot, innit</h2>
<p>you very quickly realize that you are on a constant ticking timer. it took me anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour to record and edit a vertical video (yes i am aware that is a very slow speed) and it meant i was spending anywhere from 2-3 hours making vertical videos. a horizontal video takes me 3-5 hours to record, edit, and publish. put those two things together aaaaand we are spending 5-8 hours a day making videos. thats a full time job!</p>
<h2>yeah this sucks actually</h2>
<p>anytime i've thought of; going to the store, eating out, hanging out with friends, taking a nap(!?) - instantly you do arithmetics to figure out if you can even squeeze that into your schedule! you want to go to the store? well, now you have 2 less hours in order for you to make that video today! no pressure!</p>
<h2>oh glob its getting existential</h2>
<p>for as fun and rewarding as it can be - it was also a highly intensive 9-5. where i was often working, in a 9-5 schedule. and when things are that compressed - you start to think about the value of your own time, and your mental health. it was during this month where i realized that this was not REALLY the path i wanted to go down. i enjoyed making videos at a faster rate - i enjoyed the almost daily content! but i didn't enjoy the stress or worry of having to stick to such a hard schedule. especially because, afterall, it was a hobby. and i should treat it as such.</p>
<p>this was a fun experiment, and i think i'll continue making videos at this more faster rate, with less pressure to make sure everything's perfect, and instead focusing on it being fun. maybe i miss a day, maybe i'm ahead by a day - but its healthier to think "i won't be able to get one out today, because i need to relax and get groceries." and its good to realize that missing a day isn't the end of the world.</p>
