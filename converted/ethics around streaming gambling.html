<h1>ethics around streaming gambling</h1>
<p><img src ="website/ethics around streaming gambling 1.png" class="thumbnail"></p>
<h2>gachas and gambling</h2>
<p>in my goal to play games ive never expirienced before, i got into cookie run kingdom, along side a handful of gachas. ive never been a huge fan of the gacha system from a personal enjoyment level, but as these games are ever increasingly growing, its become more and more apperant that they are gaining popularity, and players will have to get used to interacting with these systems. people might argue that gachas aren't exactly gambling but gachas are a subsection of gambling (paying virtual, and real currency at a chance to gain something). and there's been enough data out there to showcase that the effects on players are similar enough.</p>
<h2>you are being analysed</h2>
<p>first lets consider the psychological effects of gambling. gambling, by design is addictive, predatory, and engineered to be as effective as possible. this isn't hyperbole. there is a lot of money, psychology, clever engineering and design that goes into ensuring you will roll the dice. in "addiction by design, by natasha dow schull", we get this excerpt:</p>
<pre><code>they (gamblers who repeatedly play in casinos) and thousands of other players like them are the ones who teach us the most about making successful casino games. that's why casino slot managers spend so much time watching and listening to players.
</code></pre>
<p>you might have heard of "skinner boxes" before, but they are pivital to understanding gambling. burrhus frederic skinner, an american psychologist, and the father of behavior analysis created the aptly named "skinner box", which helped us further understand human behavior. in the skinner box: an animal presses a button for food - which primes it to assositate an action to a reward. in subsequent presses the button will only sometimes give food - the action of which caused animals to become addicted to pressing the button in anticipation for a reward. the process and potential of a reward was found to be more addictive than the reward itself.</p>
<h2>gambling online is even worse!</h2>
<p>one of the things that makes this icredibly difficult and dangerous in our current landscape is that (especially online), with the precense of gachas, loot boxes, packs etc.  the terms, laws, and restrictions on them are extremely vague and blurry. in the gdc talk on lootboxes - "loot boxes: legal pitfalls and loopholes", we get this excerpt:</p>
<pre><code>what is a lootbox? answer: it depends. (...) there is no law or regulatory body governing the use of loot boxes.
</code></pre>
<p>gambling in online spaces are more likely to be ruled by app stores, and game publishers than actual laws. in that same conference we continue by saying:</p>
<pre><code>frustratingly, apple doesn't have formal rules for what to do if you mess up. so my best advice (if you mess up) is fix the game, start to disclose in advance, and then do nothing else. and then if apple comes talk to you? appologize, negotiate with them, work out a solution. - but there's actually no formal process for how to remity a violation.
</code></pre>
<p>online there's little regulation, and more opportunity for exploitation. this is only enhanced further in online gambling, where your data is so abundant and easy to gather, that it makes researching effective systems, incredibly easy. data has proven the effectiveness of targeting repeated players - in online spaces these players are given the term "whales" by developers - players who will spend exorbitant amounts of currency on your games. and developers have learned how to get these whales to spend the most amount of currency possible on said games.</p>
<h2>promoting gambling</h2>
<p>gambling itself is a huge topic. another required conversation is streaming (or uploading) that media. it is one thing to wrestle with these systems. it is another to actively promote these systems to an audience.</p>
<p>my interal conflict - the reason for this article came from a comment on a youtube video i had created, which said: "make a whole vid just gachaing people would love it lol" and listen! i'm sure it would! if i was more careless or less ethical or stupid, i wouldve done that a long time ago!</p>
<p>in 2025-06-09, twitch enforced its rules on streaming while driving, sharing private information, and gambling. this is because for years the platform has been filled with content of people actively gambling, and promoting gambling. it also contained its fair share of gambling-related scams, in which creators were paid by gambling companies to showcase gambling in appealing light.</p>
<p>the more specific we get, the more lines are gray and opinions will shift. (that goes for me as well). how does "creator paid to promote gambling on a casino website" differ from "creator paid to promote a new update of a game, which just so happens to have a gacha system, a new thing you can unlock in that gacha system, and the creator just so happens to have gotten in game currency to spend"</p>
<p>how does a video where all you do is gamble for 20 minutes, unlocking appealing characters, with highly specialized visual and sound effects to an audience of (according to my analytics) 15-25 year olds sound?</p>
<p>what about playing a game and only gambling once or twice a video to that same demographic? what about a game that has gambling, and you are aware that i did gamble, but i never actively gamble in the video?</p>
<h2>the fear of missing out</h2>
<p>in a video by folding ideas, dubbed "manufactured discontent and fortnite", we get the excerpt:</p>
<pre><code>there's a level of hostility in the design. if you don't buy in you're not meerely limited in your options of expression. you are actively denied control over the extent of your vitual self.
</code></pre>
<p>in promoting gambling, it is an active sign - to everyone who has not yet gotten here - a goalpost to spotlight to you! yes you! that you, can eventually get "here", and get "all of this", if you just gamble a little more. it is one thing to personally interact with these systems, it is another to showcase them to an audience, and to create social pressure.</p>
<p>ending off with another quote from that same folding ideas video:</p>
<pre><code>the underlying purpose of demonstrating all this, is to show the mechanisms the creators are willing to deploy. these psychological tricks are in effect: a form of rhetoric. a form of persuasive speech.
</code></pre>
<p>it is simply to show what the creators are willing to do, and how far they're willing to go.</p>
<h2>some good news to end things off with...</h2>
<p>this was in response to cookie run kingdom, which itself i've heard pretty positive things (at least in comparison to things like genshin impact, or dragon ball z dokkan battle) - the community, from what ive heard so far, seems pretty contempt.</p>
<p>i have yet to play enough of it, or gachas in general to fully come up with an opinion on how "good" this gacha is. but its high credibility by its fans gives me a little more faith, and makes me feel just a little less guilty about playing it in front of an audience.</p>
