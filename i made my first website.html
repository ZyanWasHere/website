<h2>cool! why would you... do that?</h2>
<p>seriously: this isn't the 90s! it sounds silly to make a website because we don't use the internet in that way anymore. youtube and twitter, tiktok and so forth are the prodomenary ways of sharing information with eachother, to the point that: going to individual websites, and even going out of your way to search for them is uncommon. but i wanted to make one.</p>
<p>why? i think its a matter of presentation. social media websites are bastions for content. you're encouraged to post attention grabbing media, and recieve immidiete feedback. personal websites on the other hand do a pretty poor job at that. this site for one can't recieve any feedback. you can't comment in the site. i don't have easy access to data, i don't know how long you stayed here. and i'm not encouraged to post... anything. there's very little external reward.</p>
<h2>if there's so little reward why even make one?</h2>
<p>personal websites are useful! first and foremost - they're personal. its similar to monthly newsletters where you get updates on everything i've been doing. secondly they are great for technical explinations, guides, and progress updates.</p>
<p>these sites require a level of attentiveness. you can re-read sections you don't understand, and take your own time. i can easily send you through endless <a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">rabbit holes</a>, and you can ignore them or come back later. it's like watching a video vs facetime. it's like writing a book vs a letter to a penpal. that's what this is to me.</p>

<h2>i wanted to try this earlier</h2>
<p>inspired by people like: <a href="https://www.lemmi.no/">lemmino</a>, <a href="https://ncase.me/">nicky case</a> and  <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">hundreds of rabbits</a>. i wanted to make my own website! the problem? i had no idea how... it was information overload! last year i managed to lose my own domain because i didn't know i had to pay to keep a domain... yep... i was really out of my element...</p>
<p>look: making a website is a spectrum. you used to be able to do it for free on a website called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">geocities</a>. a similar platform exists today called <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>. i've even seen some artists use <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>! if you want more professional and expensive, there's <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">obsidian publish</a> and even further down the ladder you get <a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a> and so forth.</p>

<h2>so why'd you choose the hard option?</h2>
<p>the truth is: i wanted full creative control over the site... and i just wanted to. AND i'm not alone: <a href="https://www.lemmi.no/">lemmino</a> made their website with plane html, css &amp; javascript. <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">hundreds of rabbits</a>, made their site with c89 (which appears to be a version of c - the programming language?).</p>
<p>and doing it myself goes with my guidelines: i want something simple - meaning i don't harvest data, track cookies, nothing. i want something modular - something i can add and remove stuff easily to. i want something understandable - you can find everything i made on <a href="https://github.com/ZyanWasHere/website">github</a>.</p>
