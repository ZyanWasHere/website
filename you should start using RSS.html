<h1>you should start using RSS</h1>

<h1>what even is RSS?</h1>
<p>right now, we have dozens of social media apps, in order to check any notifications or updates you must visit each website individually. this can be overwhelming... the solution? RSS! it essentially gathers every notification, and puts it all in one place! and the best part? its not a single app, its an idea that's open to anyone. so there's multiple apps and add-ons that use RSS. you want to see your RSS feed in your browser? there's a browser add-on! you want an app that notifies you every time someone from any site you follow has posted? that exists! you don't even need an account to follow feeds. which means more privacy too!</p>
<h1>okay what's the catch</h1>
<p>learning it sucks - it was kind of confusing to get into. ideally you can just get an rss reader and start. but since anyone can make an rss reader - there's dozens to choose from. some want you to pay monthly, some want you to sign in, some don't require anything, but that also means syncing things is up to you!</p>
<p>you do it yourself - but okay lets say you DO get an rss reader. cool! now you actually have to get the feeds. great!... you have to go get every feed, and organize where you want them, and what folder it should go in... there's also no algorithm exposing you to new creators and no algorithm sorting your feeds. its all on you.</p>
<p>quality is questionable - rss feeds can be made by anyone. often times they're great, simple to read things. other times they feel frankensteined together, because the person writing the notifications doesn't know how to do it properly. so you might get one that's formatted well, with images and all - and another that's smushed together.</p>
<p>no social interaction - its strange right? but rss readers are just notifications to YOU. but there's no interaction between you and your friends for example. so you can't see what others have liked or commented on, without going into that notification (and thus, that website)</p>
<h1>what did i end up using</h1>
<p>there's a lot of rss readers out there. the problem is they all have their own quirks. some readers require you to pay monthly to use them, some only allow you to follow x amount of feeds, some are only for windows or linux or macs. i think this within itself, might be the biggest hurdle. to see which one might work for you: see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">the wikipedia page about RSS feeds</a> or <a href="https://openrss.org/apps">openrss</a>. despite these being big lists of RSS feeds, once you start to pick away the things you DONT want, the list gets substantually smaller... i had plenty of requirements, and in the end: feedbro was the only thing that fullfilled those requirements.  its an extension for your web browser. so you don't even have to download an app.</p>
