<h1 id="i-made-my-first-website-">i made my first website!</h1>
<p>uh... why? seriously! this isn&#39;t the 90&#39;s anymore! well, it sounds silly to make a website NOW - because we don&#39;t use the internet that way anymore. it&#39;s all on youtube and twitter and tiktok and so forth. THOSE are how you use the internet now! but i still wanted to make one!</p>
<p>is it weird to say that: websites are the one bastion where you CAN post whatever you want? surely you can post whatever you want on youtube and tiktok, you can even livestream your thoughts! but the &quot;context&quot; is different. the &quot;packaging&quot; is more present.</p>
<p>shortform content means your videos need to be a certain length, at a certain aspect ratio, with a certain amount of &quot;jiggle keys look at this ooOOOooh!&quot;. on a website? you can talk about anything. as slow or fast as you want! i can post books i&#39;ve written here, and take you to random  <a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">rabbit holes</a> in a way that just doesn&#39;t work on other platforms.</p>
<h1 id="i-wanted-to-try-this-earlier">i wanted to try this earlier</h1>
<p>inspired by people like: <a href="https://www.lemmi.no/">lemmino</a>, <a href="https://ncase.me/">nicky case</a> and  <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">hundreds of rabbits</a>. i wanted to make my own website! the problem? i had no idea how... it was information overload! last year i managed to lose my own domain because i didn&#39;t know i had to pay to keep a domain... yep... i was really out of my element...</p>
<p>look: making a website is a spectrum. you used to be able to do it for free on a website called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">geocities</a>. a similar platform exists today called <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>. i&#39;ve even seen some artists use <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>! if you want more professional and expensive, there&#39;s <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">obsidian publish</a> and even further down the ladder you get <a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a> and so forth.</p>
<p>so what did i go with? simple HTML + CSS. it&#39;s like a car from the 60&#39;s! &quot;it uhh can turn on and go! no fancy widgets here!&quot; - we don&#39;t even have javascript running on this thing! that&#39;s right. i wanted it to be simple, stripped down, and barebones! why? because i wanted to learn how to make a website! in fact this website is written purely in markdown, and compiled in C. check out how it&#39;s made on <a href="https://github.com/ZyanWasHere/website">github</a>.</p>
