<h2>what is bitrot?</h2>
<p>"nothing gets deleted from the internet" is a common phrase you might've heard of before, usually when posting something you probably shouldn't. the idea being: its difficult to remove things you upload online. they get reposted somewhere else, shared around, often by people or platforms you have no control over, making it impossible to remove.</p>
<p>at least that's the idea. in truth: nothing lasts forever. websites shut down, users get deleted, storage gets corrupted. for movies that don't get published you have old CD's you hope don't get scratched beyond repair. for old games you hope they don't get removed from the digital libraries. for old software hopefully someone maintains decades old code... as of this year: i learned of the term "bitrot" to reffer to digitial goods "rotting away".</p>
<h2>yeah, its happened to me too</h2>
<p>i first noticed this happening for old games. this year i got into half life, portal 1, plants vs zombies, and spore - all of which are over a decade old, and have issues properly displaying, and running. even worse for older software!</p>
<p>for minecraft, there was an old piece of software called mcedit which let you edit your worlds, and that software is pertty outdated and not maintained! even worse, it's decades old. some versions have been lost to time, a lot of versions are incoherently ordered, and mislabled, after the original was lost to the internet and users had to upload versions they still had laying around.</p>
<p>even something like my website, is a constant battle against bitrot. every browser has some feature that makes it incompatible with everything else! if a new browser comes around or if they update an existing one? the website might go down!</p>

<h2>can we preserve data?</h2>
<p>this is relatively difficult to do... as i mentioned, most data that is created eventually rots, and as i see it there's a few ways something can be preserved.
- updates. keeps data available, but constantly needs maintainence
- containment. data is put in physical hardware, but new versions need physical hardware as well
- emulation. data doesn't have to be altered, but software is imperfect at mimicking old hardware.
- distilling. data is broken down into the simplest component, but limits its complexity. </p>
<p>all of these methods have their pros and cons. for example: distilling is pretty useful for text. because while its nice to have proper formatting and so forth? a simple ".txt" file can still be opened and read. a "microsoft word" file? might not be. this kind of matters to me as someone who wants to make games and software! most games that use unity for example, have a relatively short shelflife before bitrot takes over.</p>

<h2>it's work</h2>
<p>i think a lot about geocities. it was platform which hosted thousands of sites in the 90s-2010s. it famously was purchased, and then later shut down by Yahoo. for decades communities have sprawled, and shared their interests on geocities. there was everything from tv fanfic authors to mothers sharing their food recipes. and by the late 2010's Yahoo had cut their losses with geocities, and effectively shut everything down.</p>
<p>right around that time, many preservationalists attempted to save the sites. as the platform was shutting down dozens of sites were being taken off the web. preserving any website was a race against the clock, as many tried to download any of the data before it completely vanished. before a lot of the websites were saved, they were gone... in the end nearly a terabyte of data was preserved, but countless websites were destroyed. today you can still visit old <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/">geocity sites</a> thanks to people making, and maintaining ways of accessing those old sites.</p>
<p>generally, things only last because we value them enough to preserve them. it takes care, and effort to keep things alive.</p>
