<h1>2025 log</h1>
<p>an updated log of everything that i'm working on, and everything that's been made!</p>
<h2>2025-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>started spooktober</li>
</ul>
<p>for the month of october i decided to stream everyday, as well as post daily to youtube, tiktok, instagram, and twitter. as well as playing a variety of horror related games and doing october related activities. if is fun enough, it might be a yearly tradition - who knows.</p>
<h2>2025-09</h2>
<ul>
<li>created a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/bpfvT2r9yf">discord</a></li>
<li>added <a href="is bitrot inevitible.html">is bitrot inevitible</a></li>
<li>added <a href="making my own fantasy console part 1 research.html">making my own fantasy console part 1 research</a></li>
<li>added <a href="making my own fantasy console part 2 coding.html">making my own fantasy console part 2 coding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>one of the best things you can do is eliminate points of friction. for me: that occurs in a lot of the tools i use on a daily basis. recently <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/60aW-lqBtQw?si=0XCVIzB6Angi_zG4">i've been trying to make fast, consistent vertical content</a>. i wanted to do more than just "upload clip", and that means a lot of the work goes into the visuals. to fix that i've been making custom tools to speed the process up. some of those tools come in the form of unity projects, some come in the form of fantasy consoles.</p>
<h2>2025-08</h2>
<ul>
<li>updated <a href="faq.html">faq</a></li>
<li>tweaked the css</li>
<li>tweaked the html</li>
</ul>
<p>as this month continues i've been setting up: wheel of hobbies. a series where i try different hobbies, and share with you my journey. the idea caterpillar snuck inside the brain apple, and has lingered in there enough to become a project butterfly.</p>
<h2>2025-07</h2>
<ul>
<li>added <a href="what even IS acceptable content.html">what even IS acceptable content</a></li>
<li>tweaking the css</li>
<li>updated <a href="i made my first website.html">i made my first website</a></li>
<li>updated <a href="faq.html">faq</a></li>
</ul>
<p>this month was PACKED! it felt like i hardly had time to do anything! i jumpstarted the channel (zyanwashere) and continued the other (infinite thoughts). i have some insights and made a whole article about it - check the added things from this month.</p>
