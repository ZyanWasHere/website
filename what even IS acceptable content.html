<h2>there's a lot of things i don't agree with</h2>
<p>there's a lot of things i wouldn't personally promote. one of them is gambling. it's a big joke to play into gambling, i do it sometimes when i'm playing a game, but actually promoting it in any way? not something i feel particularly comfortable doing, especially when i know a portion of my audience is more susceptible to that kind of thing.</p>
<p>same goes with promoting alchohol or some quick scam to make money. but the thing is everyone draws the line somewhere, and i realize i'm on one side of the extreme while other people are a lot more loose, and willing to accept certain things.</p>
<h2>there are a few things that YOU do agree with</h2>
<p>as a more grounded example: i am not a fan of the monetization of many games. i do not like how games like my singing monsters, and cookie run kingdom, apex legends, or clash royale monetize their games. i find a lot of their strategies to be concerning and predatory. and i would personally choose not to promote these things, because i have seen from firsthand accounts what kind of harm these monetization methods can bring.</p>
<p>that being said, a lot of my audience IS okay with this content. they either do not see it as an issue, or see it as an issue which isn't extreme enough to be addressed. if it is a big issue, its also usually one that you sigh at, and complain about, before continuing through with what you were doing. admittedly i can be persuade to go along with it. for as much as i despise these monetization methods, i'm also not really dying on this hill.</p>
<p>when playing these games in front of an audience, many seem overjoyed at the mere fact that i'm simple playing the game they enjoy. the monetization issue is just like a "yeah, we know..." comment afterwards. and so its clear that the line of what is acceptable is blurry, and partially community driven. afterall, i think the people who actually see the content should be able to put in their two cents on: what kind of content they WANT to see.</p>

<h2>compromise</h2>
<p>i realize there's much needed compromise when it comes to these kind of things. for gambling content specifically: people HAVE been kicked out platforms for promoting gambling, and the general opinion is that its pretty sketchy.</p>
<p>something more blurry would be like sponsorships where you see creators talking about products that people deem unethical. the line for what "is unethical" turns out to be pretty blurry too... a clear example would be when a company outright lies about what they're promoting. online therapy, online coupons - that kind of deal. and when it turns out people don't have certain credentials or your data is being stolen, then you normally see complaints.</p>
<p>on the other hand things like expensive merchandise also get a lot of scrutiny online despite it being way more ethical than the previously scummy-er things we've mentioned. i think the bar sways and flows with what people expect of the creator. which is why i think having conversations about these kind of things are important. there should be mutual compromise about whats acceptable. maybe i'll ask a few people from the community, or during streams, about topics or things i plan to do just to get an overview reaction.</p>
